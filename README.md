# HANGMAN-CLI
a command line hangman game created using JS constructors.

Technologies Used
Node.js, npm, JavaScript including object constructors, prompt npm package

I had a issue with scope in my functions being called but I figured it out.

Another issue I had and am still having is getting the word to display as you guess the correct letters. It tells you if you are right or wrong but doesnt show the word until the end.
